## Inputs

All inputs are in a folder in the GitHub repository
[`~/input`](https://github.com/tylerjamesbrown7/co_tk/tree/96052d8bcd845533dcea3d6e7d44cb88c3595309/input).

You will need:

-   `isco68_TO_isco88.xlsx`
-   `crosswalk_oficio_isco.xlsx`

## Instructions

1.  [This
    paper](https://repository.urosario.edu.co/server/api/core/bitstreams/d4925f02-0c79-4671-8013-aeba548c854b/content)
    had a workflow for linking ISCO-08 codes to the Colombian CNO-70
    codes.

2.  The CNO-70 codes are based on the ISCO-68 Level 2 classifications.
    (They seem to be identical).
    [Here](http://www.harryganzeboom.nl/isco68/), you will find a
    crosswalk from ISCO-68 to ISCO-88. If you have SPSS, you can open
    the files. I opened it as raw text and edited them manually in
    Excel, which you can find
    [here](https://github.com/tylerjamesbrown7/co_tk/blob/3ea22042ffb42ad474659f7c74390a4b5098a967/input/isco68_TO_isco88.xlsx).

3.  There is a convenient package for converting occupation codes, which
    you can find
    [here](https://guidowe.github.io/occupationcross/index.html). After
    installing this in the R file, you should be able to call
    `reclassify_to_isco08()` on `isco68_TO_isco88`. Two CNO-70 codes,
    `49` and `70`, will not transfer. I subsituted in the first
    occupation in each category, which is not an issue as long as you
    use the Level 2 codes in the final analysis (which matches the
    CNO-70 structure anyway).

4.  Optionally, you can merge this with the ISCO-08 descriptions from
    `crosswalk_oficio_isco.xlsx` in the second sheet. It does not
    populate all codes, but it is helpful for readability.

5.  Finally, you can generate the output `.csv` file. When merging, you
    should use the column `isco08_l2` in order to avoid issues with some
    of the missing occupations. (In the future, I can try to repair the
    broken codes). Since the ISCO structure is hierarchical, there wonâ€™t
    be an issue at higher levels. Between versions, some occupations
    were collapsed together or phased out, hence the discrepancy. You
    can also find the Colombian descriptions in the variable
    `cno70_desc` if that is useful.
